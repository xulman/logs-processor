/**
 * interface that knows how to display the (x,y,msg) input triples
 *
 * the triples are fed in the guaranteed order: all from one 'x' is shipped
 * before any other 'x' is provided (since 'x' are considered labels, not
 * values/coordinates on the x-axis, no ordering is assumed here -- instead,
 * the order established from user of this class is used); within the same 'x'
 * the order of incoming triples is dictated by a natural ordering of the
 * 'y' values (from the smallest to the largest) - this order must be enforced
 * outside, the interface only draws stuff relying on this order
